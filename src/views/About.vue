      <h3>Information Collected on Movie Suggest</h3>
      <br><br>
Movie Suggest analyzes your viewing history on Netflix and uses that to suggest movies you would like based on history result. We don't store anything from that. All of the recommendation happens on the fly and ends there. We are looking to make the platform stable so it automatically keeps session of suggested movies, but that would be in the future.
<br><br>
<h3>Third party services </h3>
<br><br>
Movie Suggest  uses Chrome (Chromium) or WebExtensions Storage Sync API for storing user's settings and browser's Web Storage API (localStorage) for storing user's Developer Tools fixes.
